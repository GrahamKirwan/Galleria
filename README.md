## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- NextJS
- Framer Motion for animations
- Flexbox & CSS Grid for masonry layout
- Vercel for deployment


### App logic

The goal here was to make a fully responsive and intuitive application with emphasis placed on UX and UI design. The aim was also to make the app as fast and snappy as possible, done so by utilizing static site generation and NextJS Image tags.
- Users have a nice slideshow experience with fluid animations throughout.



### Notes & Continued development

There appears to be an occasional bug when exiting the slideshow where the artist image enlarges to take up the full screen very briefly.
